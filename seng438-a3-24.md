# 1 Introduction

Text…

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Text…

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Our team managed the work effort first by working all together to set up the testing environment on each individuals machines. Raina created the data flow graph for the method calculateColumnTotal because she was the most familiar with it. Domo created the other data flow graph for contains because he created the tests for it in the last assignment. Increasing code coverage of our test suite started with each person trying to increase the tests they created in the previous assignment. Once we had completed our tests we proceeded to start completing test cases for the Range Class methods that we had not done in the previous assignment. This got us to the necessary coverage milestones.
