# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we further developed our understanding of software testing by developing white box test cases to evaluate different code coverages. Our goal was to utilize the content covered in lecture to gain practical experience with white box testing.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

## Data-flow coverage calculations
### Range.contains():
### DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(): 

= DU-pairs tested / total DU-pairs 
= 17 / 28 = 60.71% DU pair coverage

Work for 3.2 of the Lab Instructions
3.2.3 DU-pairs per variable

### Range.contains()
| **Variable** | **DU-pairs**  |
|----------------|----------|
| this.lower | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| this.upper | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| value | (0, 1), (0, 2) |

### DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal()
| **Variable** | **DU-pairs**  |
|----------------|----------|
| data | (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 12) |
| column | (0, 7), (0, 12) |
| total | (2, 9), (2, 14), (9, 9), (14, 14) |
| rowCount | (3, 5), (3, 11) |
| n | (7, 8), (7, 9), (12, 13), (12, 14) |
| r | (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 10), (10, 10), (10, 8), (10, 9) |
| r2 | (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 15), (15, 15), (15, 11), (15, 12) |

3.2.4 Test cases and the pairs covered

### Range.contains(double)
| **Test Case** | **DU-pairs covered**  |
|----------------|----------|
| testInRangeValueForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testPositiveOutOfRangeValueForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testNegativeOutOfRangeValueForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testBelowUpperBoundaryForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testEqualToUpperBoundaryForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testAboveUpperBoundaryForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testBelowLowerBoundaryForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testEqualToLowerBoundaryForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testAboveLowerBoundaryForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |
| testNominalValueForMethodContains() | (0, 1), (0, 2) |

### DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal()
| **Test Case** | **DU-pairs covered**  |
|----------------|----------|
| testCalculateColumnTotalForTwoValues() | (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 7), (2, 9), (9, 9), (3, 5), (3, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 10), (10, 10), (10, 8), (10, 9), (6, 11) |
| testCalculateColTotalForNegativeValues() | (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 7), (2, 9), (9, 9), (3, 5), (3, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 10), (10, 10), (10, 8), (10, 9), (6, 11) |
| testCalcColNullDataThrowsException() | (0, 1) |
| testCalcColumnNullObject() | (0, 1) |



# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Our team managed the work effort first by working all together to set up the testing environment on each individuals machines. Raina created the data flow graph for the method calculateColumnTotal because she was the most familiar with it. Domo created the other data flow graph for contains because he created the tests for it in the last assignment. Increasing code coverage of our test suite started with each person trying to increase the tests they created in the previous assignment. Once we had completed our tests we proceeded to start completing test cases for the Range Class methods that we had not done in the previous assignment. This got us to the necessary coverage milestones.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

We found this lab to be well organized and have a good workflow structure, we felt the work expectations were clear and had a good understanding of what was expected during the in lab demo. The supplementary powerpoint offered a good overview for the learning goals of the assignment.  We gained a better understanding of white box testing and how to use the JUnit framework. Overall this was an enjoyable lab that was understandable and easy to work on in a group.
