# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we further developed our understanding of software testing by developing white box test cases to evaluate different code coverages. Our goal was to utilize the content covered in lecture to gain practical experience with white box testing.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

## Data-flow coverage calculations
#### Range.contains():
#### DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(): 

= DU-pairs tested / total DU-pairs 
= 17 / 28 = 60.71% DU pair coverage

### Work for 3.2 of the Lab Instructions
#### 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 Data Flow Graph and def-use pairs labelled at every node

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

1. One test that was added to the DataUtilitiesTest file that increased the code coverage of the DataUtilities class was testGetCumulativePercentages_AllNullValues(). This test case targets the getCumulativePercentage(KeyedValues data) function, specifically parts of the function that deal with null values within the KeyedValues object that is taken in as an arguement. This was achieved by setting up a KeyedValues mock with 3 items of valid keys and values of null. Passing this object into the function increased branch coverage by hitting the "False" for most if/else statements within the function.

2. Another test that was added to the DataUtilitiesTest file that increased code coverage was the testEqual_SameContent() function. This test case targets the equal(double[][] a, double[][] b) function. This test case creates two new double[][] objects which contain the same content then passes those objects to the function. This tess is designed to hit the "False" on the first three if statements, then enetering the for loop but hitting the negative on the if statement within the loop. This function was not included in the Javadoc documentation that we initially used to write the test cases for this class in assignment 2, therefor this increased method coverage by 100%, branch coverage by ~50% and line coverage by ~60%. Eveything that this test case covered was an improvement to the original reported coverage.

As seen in the images provided the coverage percentages for our chosen metrics are:
    <br>Line coverage = 89.6% = ~90%
  <br>Branch coverage = 79.7% = ~80%
  <br>Method Coverage = 100%

### Methods with 100% coverage on all three chosen metrics (Line, Branch, Method):
  <br>clone(double[][])
  <br>createNumberArray(double[])
  <br>createNumberArray2D(double[][])
  <br>equal(double[][], double[][])

### Methods without 100% coverage on all three chosen metrics (Line, Branch, Method):
#### calculateColumnTotal(Values2D, int)

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Our team managed the work effort first by working all together to set up the testing environment on each individuals machines. Raina created the data flow graph for the method calculateColumnTotal because she was the most familiar with it. Domo created the other data flow graph for contains because he created the tests for it in the last assignment. Increasing code coverage of our test suite started with each person trying to increase the tests they created in the previous assignment. Once we had completed our tests we proceeded to start completing test cases for the Range Class methods that we had not done in the previous assignment. This got us to the necessary coverage milestones.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

We found this lab to be well organized and have a good workflow structure, we felt the work expectations were clear and had a good understanding of what was expected during the in lab demo. The supplementary powerpoint offered a good overview for the learning goals of the assignment.  We gained a better understanding of white box testing and how to use the JUnit framework. Overall this was an enjoyable lab that was understandable and easy to work on in a group.
